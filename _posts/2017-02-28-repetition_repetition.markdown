I've found, that for my brain, repetition is the way to go when it comes to learning pretty much anything. I would like to see alittle bit more repetition in the lessons presented here. Now that I've reached the final project for the JavaScript section, I'm now starting to repeat some of the things done in the lessons so the use of these techniques are becomming clearer. 

It's been said that to become an expert, one needs to invest 10,000 hours in a task. But this shouldn't be a daunting milestone for any new student. A Doctor becomes a specialist in a field, but they are still required to know other things about medicine. They can still do things outside their specialty because they have the ability to synthesize the issue and use the resources they have to diagnose and remedy the problem. This is the same for programmers. 

Having the ability to use prior skills and learning capabilities any programmer can adapt to a new language and excel in it. So don't be afraid that you haven't put in the work in a particular language if you're presented with an opportunity to do something new. That repetition comes with trying new things and before you know it you'll add another expert tool in your toolbox.
