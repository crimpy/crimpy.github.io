As I learned some new topics here in the lessons, I found myself resisting some of the techniques presented in the lessons because I learned either older ways of doing things, comfort in doing these things the old way or just plain old stubbornness. 

One good thing is that I've identified my sutbbornness and I've accepted a willingness to change. But it's still difficult to get over some things. I totally get that EMCA6 methods are where JavaScript code is going and that I need to make adjustments in what I know with what I need to know to maintain current. Another one I've been struggling with is using the inline incorporation of variables into strings instead of using the plus sign. Despite all of the drawbacks to using plus, I still want to use this method... now I just need to take my own advice and Stop It!

One thing that I have had a problem with in terms of habits, is the lack of the use of semicolons in the lessons here. In previous classes that I've had in University, I was told that I should *always* use a semi-colon to end a statement. But I find that the lessons rarely use them. I understand that there are stylistinc ways of programming. I'll even say that in many cases, there are "right" and "wrong" ways of coding. But I think that these courses should attempt to tackle the conventions and best practices in coding. I know why semi-colons are good to use, but is there an argument against them? This seems to be something that could be argued by the Learn instructors?

I know that there are many habits I need to change to be a better coder, but as this is an art-form, as long as my habits do not counteract good practices, I will maintain some of my old habits the way they are so as to keep my stylistic elements.
