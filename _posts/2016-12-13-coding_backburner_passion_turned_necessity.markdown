I spent many years of my career as a Professional Geologist working in Environmental and Mining Consulting. While this work was rewarding and has allowed me to meet people and see place all over the world, it is and has been a cyclical industry. Because of this, I had to make a radical career change to prevent me from going broke.

I chose to get into software development because it was something that I had always dabbled with in the past and has always been something that I feel is creative, challenging and diverse. As a Geologist, I dealt with data on a regular basis and often needed to produce data visualizations to analyze my work. This was often repetitive and time consuming. I started to use Excel VBA to automate some of my charts and formulas. Then I found some JavaScript charting APIs and started to tinker with using VBA to write web pages with embedded data and JavaScript. This allowed me to produce rich interactive charts instead of the static Excel charts. It just evolved from there as I picked up more things and other languages (like PHP) and database interactivity. I taught myself to do some pretty complex applications mostly by copying an example, reading up on forums like StackOverflow, and trial and error. But The problem was I had a lot of holes in my knowledge and some bad habits to overcome.  I love the satisfaction of making something that looks good, works well, and exceeds expectations. I love the pride that comes with completing and owning a project. 

This is how I got here. I've written some websites from scratch as the only developer on the project. It was a completely full-stack experience including setting up the Linux Environment to run the site. But despite my accomplishments, I was lacking discipline, structure and a lot of fundamentals that I never needed to know to accomplish my projects. In addition, interviewing has been difficult because I haven't done enough projects to know the intricacies of language and the view of the big picture. This is what I expect to get when I'm done here. 

Because I find coding fun it's been a fun journey up to now and I'm looking forward to the many many more things I plan to learn in the future!
