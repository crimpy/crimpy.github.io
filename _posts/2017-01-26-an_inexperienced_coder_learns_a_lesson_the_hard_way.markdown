Having completed a project to design a customer portal system that allows customers to view and purchase software upgrades and maintenance I learned as the oriject progressed that it would have been useful to first learn OOP pricipals better.

It's easy to look back at a project and feel, "I should have done this, or that". There are many obsticals that are faced early on like budget and time which were things I was faced with. I knew I could implement the entire project using a procedural approach in a shorter amount of time. And as I went along, I learned more OOP principals that I 'could have' used to make thing more efficnent. 

Since I was inexperienced and working solo on the project, I was faced with just getting things done and woryying about changes later. I'm realizing that had I put some more time in the beginning struggling with new OOP code and pushing through the learning curve, I would have been able to more easily made signiicant improvements later on with less effort. 

I have a lot of plans for expanding my system to do more things and work faster and more efficnently, but now I need to rethink the entire way I have done things and essentially rebuild the back end code for a v2.0 remake. It's going to take a lot of time to do this and I'm still going to need to spend time in a planning phase which I skipped in lieu of a 'seat of my pants' approach. 

This project has been an evolution of what and where and how and answering the question of whether it could be done or not. Ultimately though, I realize now that I should have done more planning and using the best tools available right off the start instead of starting over. The best part of it all is that my boss has no clue about any of this stuff and despite telling him there needs to be a revamping of the code, hes been very pleased with what I have put together to date and that makes me think that this may have been the path I was supposed to go down.
